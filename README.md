# GFMMarkdown Editor

This is an online (in the browser) editor with live preview.
Its specificity is to support [Github Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/): I was not able to find any tool for it, except the inline editor on Github website (but you can't have at the same time the editor and the preview!).

Work in progress, whould be done very very soon!

## Online demo

As soon as it's finished!

## Requirements

It uses [Twitter Bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower) to fetch used libraries, so you can run ```bower install```
